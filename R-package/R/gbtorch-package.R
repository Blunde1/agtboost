#' GBTorch is a lightning fast gradient boosting library designed to avoid manual tuning and cross-validation by utilizing an information theoretic approach. This makes the algorithm adaptive to the dataset at hand; it is completely automatic, and with minimal worries of overfitting. Consequently, the speed-ups relative to state-of-the-art implementations are in the thousands while mathematical and technical knowledge required on the user are minimized.
