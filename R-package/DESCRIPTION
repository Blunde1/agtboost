Description: aGTBoost is a lightning fast gradient boosting library designed
    to avoid manual tuning and cross-validation by utilizing an information
    theoretic approach. This makes the algorithm adaptive to the dataset at
    hand; it is completely automatic, and with minimal worries of overfitting.
    Consequently, the speed-ups relative to state-of-the-art implementations
    are in the thousands while mathematical and technical knowledge required
    on the user are minimized.
