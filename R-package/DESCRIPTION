Description: Fast and automatic gradient tree boosting designed
    to avoid manual tuning and cross-validation by utilizing an information
    theoretic approach. This makes the algorithm adaptive to the dataset at
    hand; it is completely automatic, and with minimal worries of overfitting.
    Consequently, the speed-ups relative to state-of-the-art implementations
    can be in the thousands while mathematical and technical knowledge required
    on the user are minimized.
